            <p> In the 19th century, mathematicians such as <strong>Georg Cantor</strong> and <strong>Helge von Koch</strong> explored "pathological" sets and curves that defied classical geometry. 
              Cantor's set, created by repeatedly removing the middle third of a line segment, revealed a set that is uncountably infinite yet has zero length. Similarly, Koch's snowflake, with its infinitely jagged perimeter but finite area, demonstrated that simple iterative rules can produce structures of infinite complexity. 
              These early discoveries challenged traditional notions of dimension and laid the groundwork for modern fractal thinking.</p>

            <p>In the early 20th century, mathematicians <strong>Gaston Julia</strong> and <strong>Pierre Fatou</strong> investigated the iteration of complex functions. 
              Their research produced intricate, often self-repeating patterns that foreshadowed modern fractals. Julia and Fatou’s work revealed that applying simple mathematical rules repeatedly could generate infinitely detailed structures, even from very basic formulas. 
              Although largely theoretical at the time, their studies provided essential tools for later visualizations and practical applications in computer-generated fractals.</p>

            <p>In the 1970s, <strong>Benoît Mandelbrot</strong> coined the term "fractal" to describe objects whose structure repeats at different scales. Using computers, he visualized the <em>Mandelbrot set</em>, showing how simple equations could produce infinitely complex, self-similar shapes. Mandelbrot's work not only popularized fractals but also revealed their relevance across mathematics, nature, and science. From the branching of trees to turbulent flows, his insights transformed the way we understand and model complex patterns.

              Fractals are intimately connected to <strong>chaos theory</strong>, which studies systems extremely sensitive to initial conditions. Strange attractors, such as the <em>Lorenz attractor</em>, exhibit fractal structures hidden within seemingly unpredictable dynamics. These patterns appear in weather systems, fluid flows, and ecological models, demonstrating how order and structure can emerge from apparent chaos. Fractals provide a lens to understand complexity in natural and engineered systems, revealing patterns that might otherwise remain invisible.

              Today, fractals influence a wide range of disciplines, from computer graphics and digital art to medicine, finance, and environmental modeling. Fractal geometry is used to simulate realistic landscapes, generate lifelike textures in movies, and analyze biological structures such as blood vessels and lung tissue. In finance, fractals help model irregular market behaviors, while in ecology, they describe patterns like forest growth and river networks. By connecting mathematics, nature, and technology, fractals continue to reveal the hidden order in complex systems and inspire innovation across science and art.
