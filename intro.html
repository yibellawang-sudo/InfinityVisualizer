            What is a Fractal?
        </header>
        <div class="content">
            <p>A <strong>fractal</strong> is a shape ot pattern that repeats its structure at different scales, 
            a propoerty call <strong>self-similarity</strong>. Zoom in on a fractal, and you'll keep discovering new
            details that resemble the whole. This makes fractals both mathematically fascinating and visually stunning
            </p>

        <p>
            Fractals are <strong>infinitely complex patterns</strong> created by repeating a simple process over and over
            in a continuous feedback loop. Driven by recursion, they are essentially the images of dynamic systems, or,
            the picture of <strong>Chaos</strong>. Geometrically, fractals exist in between our familiar dimensions, 
            forming shapes that are neither one nor two dimensional, but something in between.
        </p>

        <p>
            Fractals are everywhere in nature. Examples include:
            <li>Trees and plants</li>
            <li>Rivers and coastlines</li>
            <li>Mountains and clouds</li>
            <li>Seashells and hurricanes</li>
        </p>

        <p>
            Abstract fractals, such as the <strong>Mandelbrot Set</strong>, are generated by computer programs
            that repeat a simple mathemtical equation endlessly, revealing intricate patterns at every level of
            magnification.
        </p>

        <h3>Key Characteristics of Fractals</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Self-Similarity:</strong> The pattern repeates itself at smaller and smaller scales</li>
            <li><strong>Infinite Detail:</strong> Fractals possess intricate structure at all levels of magnification</li>
            <li><strong>Recursive Structure:</strong> A feedback loop creates the repeating pattern.</li>
            <li><strong>Fractal Dimension:</strong> Fractals often have a non-integer dimension, reflecting their complexity.</li>
        </ul>
