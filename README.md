# InfinityVisualizer
Welcome to Infinity Visualizer, my website, an introduction and demonstration of fractals, a space where math, beauty, and a little chaos come together. Here you’ll find explanations on what fractals are, where they are found in nature, their history and origins, development, relation to chaos theory, and modern applications! 
I also built interactive (and pretty!) demos of the Mandelbrot set, Julia sets, and the burning ship, which allow users to zoom in and play with parameters, along with explanations of the equations behind them. My goal is to make fractals feel alive and accessible, so whether you’re a math enthusiast, an artist searching for inspiration, or simply someone who enjoys beautiful patterns, you should check this out! 
This site is built with lightweight HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure a smooth and interactive experience, while also experimenting with website design and aesthetics.
